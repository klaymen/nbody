Hello stranger,

N-body is a framework and some predefined (most probably) somehow interesting experiments. The whole bunch of code is written in Python.

**System Requirements:**
   * Windows XP/7/8/8.1
   * OSX (From Yosemite 10.10.4)
   * Linux (For installing third party dependencies you might need to install pip and some other system level dependencies [libfreetype6-dev, libxft-dev, libpng-dev] as well.)
   * By time more information to come

**Third party dependencies:**
   * PyGTK 2.0 (Installing this properly might require reinstall matplotlib)
   * matplotlib 1.4.3
   * NumPy 1.9.1
   * SciPy 0.15.1 (I'm not sure if this is needed, but I think it is nice to have afterall)

*(Please note, that the version numbers are only informative, the framework might run flawlessly even with older packages.)*

*(Also, there might be some hidden dependencies, which I'm not aware of, if you found any, please let me know.)*

*(I like parentheses)*

Aaaand, it's done.
