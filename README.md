Hello stranger,

N-body is a framework and some predefined (most probably) somehow interesting experiments. The whole bunch of code is written in Python.

**System Requirements:**
   * Windows XP/7/8/8.1
   * OSX (Tried with Yosemite 10.10.4)
   * Linux (Ubuntu)
   * More to come?

**Third party dependencies:**
   * Matplotlib 1.4.3
   * NumPy 1.9.1
   * SciPy 0.15.1 (I'm not sure if this is needed, but I think it is nice to have afterall)

(Please note, that the version numbers are only informative, the framework might run flawlessly even with older packages)

Aaaand, it's done.
