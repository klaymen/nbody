Hello stranger,

N-body is a framework and some predefined (most probably) somehow interesting experiments. The whole bunch of code is written in Python.

Third party dependencies:
(Please note, that the version numbers are only informative, the framework might run flawlessly even with older packages)
    
    * Matplotlib 1.4.3
    * NumPy 1.9.1
    * SciPy 0.15.1 (I'm not sure if this is needed, but I think it is nice to have afterall)


Aaaand, it's done.
